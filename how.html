        What you need
    </div>
    <div class="head4">
    <p>1. A hidden database called a wallet. You should create a good password for this wallet.</p> 
    <p>2. A good mining software made up of cgminer and stratum.</p>
    <p>3. A account in an online mining pool, which is a community of miners who combine their computers to increase profitability and income stability.</p>
    <p>4. Membership at an online currency exchange, where you can exchange your virtual coins for conventional cash, and vice versa. </p>
    <p>5. A reliable full time internet connection, ideally 2 megabits per second or faster speed.</p>
    <p>6. A hardware setup location in your basement or other cool and air-conditioned space.  </p>
    <p>7. A desktop or custom-built computer designed for mining. Yes, you may use your current computer to start, but you won't be able to use the computer while the miner is running. A separate dedicated computer is ideal. Tip: Do not use a laptop, gaming console or handheld device to mine. These devices are not effective enough to generate income.</p>
    <p>8. An ATI graphics processing unit (GPU) or a specialized processing device called a mining ASIC chip. The cost will be anywhere from $90 used to $3000 new for each GPU or ASIC chip. The GPU or ASIC will be the workhorse of providing the accounting services and mining work.</p>
    <p>9. A house fan to blow cool air across your mining computer. Mining generates substantial heat, and cooling the hardware is critical for your success.</p>
    <p>10. Personal curiosity. You absolutely need a strong appetite for reading and constant learning, as there are ongoing technology changes and new techniques for optimizing coin mining results. The most successful coin miners spend hours every week studying the best ways to adjust and improve their coin mining performance. </p>
