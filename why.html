        <p>Cryptomining is not something that people would normally expect that they can do. For the most part it not expected that you will make a lot of money off it all the time but it is a good idea if you want to make some extra cash that would help pay for some of the electronics that you already have.</p>
        <p>The effort that is required to mine coins and the amount of effort that is required to learn about crypto coins turns people off almost instantly.</p>
        <p>The real thing is that you don't need to know that much about mining if you want to make a simple buck off of it.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is download a simple program that you connect to an account such as minergate and click start. Then you can do nothing and make money.</p>
