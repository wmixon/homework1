    </div>
    <div class="head3">
        <p>Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.</p>
        <p>Basically you can think of bitcoins as blocks of data the people create by using their processor. It creates a huge block chain which later allows people to keep track of all the transcations that they have done.</p>
